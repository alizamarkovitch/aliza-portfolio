                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Go is an order processing application used by 500K+ restaurants around the world. During its early development, the product lacked some much-needed design love. To meet the needs of a fast-expanding global market, features were quickly built on top of one another and as a result, the interface got messy.</p>
                    <p>It became increasingly important to simplify and align the design across different devices. We gave Go a visual refresh and created a collection of reusable components, forming the basis of our new design system!</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <h3>Problem</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The interface is messy creating a poor user experience</li>
                        <li>Mobile and Web UX/UI not aligned</li>
                        <li>Same information communicated in different ways</li>
                        <li>No systematic approach for designing new features. Starting from scratch every time</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improve acceptance time and reduce order fail rate by helping users easily distinguish new and active orders</li>
                        <li>Clean up UI so that it is easy for users to identify important order information</li>
                        <li>Align designs across mobile and web</li>
                        <li>Create a design system to provide a systematic approach for developing new features</li>

                    <h3>Task</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Redesign Go's order processing flow for mobile and web</li>

                    <p>I began by understanding the purpose of every element within the current design. Which information is the most important? Which could be removed. I cross-referenced the interface across mobile and web to highlight discrepancies. Together with stakeholders, we prioritized which content to carry over into the new design.</p>

                    <p>The Order Processing screen is a critical part of the Go interface. Here, users manage a summary of all their orders. I spent lots of time ideating on this screen, exploring different ways to simplify the information. Specifically, brainstorming how to improve the distinction between new and active orders.</p>

                    <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                    <p>I narrowed down my ideas into two design concepts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Concept A</strong> was a Swimlane. New orders appear as visually different cards on top of the screen.</p>
                    <p><strong>Concept B</strong> used a Drawer. By swiping the drawer up and down, users could switch between new and active orders.</p>
                    <p>But before moving to high-fidelity designs, I wanted to gather user feedback. So I created prototypes for each concept which I brought along on a vendor research trip...</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Visited 12 different restaurants</li>
                        <li>Interviewed restaurant owners and employees</li>

                    <p>Visiting restaurants in-person provided a deeper understanding of the real environment. I was curious about how our restaurants would feel about the new design concepts. From street food shops to international chains such as KFC I gathered a range of user insights.</p>

                    <p>The old design was cluttered, there was a lot of information competing on the screen. This made it challenging for users to quickly identify important information. To improve the information hierarchy, I decided to run a card sorting session.</p>
                    <p>I asked users to prioritize information such as 'Order Number' and 'Customer Name' based on each stage of the order processing flow. Many users mentioned the value of both short and long order codes as a key identifier for referencing orders.</p>

                    <p>During our restaurant visits, I showed the low-fidelity prototypes to users to find out which of the two design concepts they preferred. I asked them to practice accepting new orders and gathered feedback on their first impressions.</p>
                    <p>I learned that most people preferred the swimlane concept. They also shared that the bold colours, fonts and whitespace made it easy to differentiate between new and accepted orders. The positive feedback helped validate we were going in the right direction.</p>
