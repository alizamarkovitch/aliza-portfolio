                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>Food delivery applications have transformed the restaurant experience. Restaurants have the added responsibility of providing the same level of service to customers online as the real-life ones in front of them. However, performance expectations in a delivery app differ from a brick-and-mortar store.</p>
                    <p>Since restaurants play a significant role in providing a seamless delivery experience, we wanted to investigate how to influence them to improve their performance on the order-processing platform. <strong>We designed a feature that helps restaurants understand and track their performance goals.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Framing the problem</h2>
                    <p>Before starting to solve anything I wanted to take a look at the issue at hand and break it down to its root cause(s).</p>
                    <p>We want to influence restaurants to improve their performance on their order processing application. The underlying problem is that restaurants do not have a clear understanding of how they are performing or what it means to achieve good performance on the app. This is problematic because they are not aware of how to improve, and as a result, their online business and customer reputation are negatively impacted.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What is a "Good Performing Restaurant"?</h3>
                    <p>Through my research, I learned that this had not been clearly defined. Although the business was tracking many different metrics related to performance, it was important to focus on the goals restaurants have the most control over. Together with stakeholders, we defined a model of a Good Performing Restaurant which was comprised of three main areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Order health</li>
                        <li>Productivity</li>
                        <li>Customer perception</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Solving the problem</h2>
                    <p>Keeping these things in mind, I decided on the following mission statement:</p>
                    <p><strong>Make model of "Good Performing Restaurant" explicit</strong></p>

                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clearly define what it means to be a Good Performing Restaurant</li>
                        <li>Create a dedicated metrics screen where users can track performance goals</li>
                        <li>Highlight insights that users can take immediate action on</li>

                    <h2>Benchmarking</h2>
                    <p>To gain inspiration, I explored many different applications that have performance-related features. I noticed that all content shared the following principles:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simple</li>
                        <li>Proactive</li>
                        <li>Victorious</li>
                        <li>Goal-oriented</li>

                    <p>The conceptual direction and requirements were already pretty clear after the phases above, so I could jump straight into exploring preliminary ideas for the performance metrics screen. I tried to put in all the content and explore where to include visualization.</p>

                    <h2>Testing</h2>
                    <p>To get feedback, I shared the prototype with restaurants. I learned that customer reviews motivate them to improve their performance. Many stores regularly check reviews online or even have a physical customer comment box. I used this learning to highlight the information at the top of the screen and incentivize restaurants to regularly visit this page.</p>
