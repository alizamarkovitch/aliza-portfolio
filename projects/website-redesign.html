                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>The Centre for Free Expression (CFE) is an organization within Ryerson University that provides information about issues related to free expression in Canada and worldwide. The Center's website is a learning tool to explore information and attend events on issues around free expression topics. Many resources are used by people who teach and study in this field.</p>
                    <p>CFE's goal was to present its resources in a more user-friendly way. I created an updated design that was modern, easy to navigate, and scalable to accommodate for future growth.</p>

                    <h2>Discover</h2>
                    <h3>Understand the problem + Collect Data (Research)</h3>
                    <p>At the beginning of my discovery process, I ran a workshop session to understand what CFE does, the purpose of the Centre's website, and key pain points with the site today. The session included the following activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brand Workshop</strong> to learn about the organization and its goals (Value proposition)</li>
                        <li><strong>Website Design Audit</strong> to identify areas for improvement</li>
                        <li><strong>Google Analytics data</strong> analysis to better understand user behavior</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The outcome of the workshop was:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An <strong>Organizational Summary</strong></li>
                        <li>A <strong>Backlog</strong> of improvements and features for the new site</li>
                        <li>Defined <strong>KPIs</strong> to measure the success of the redesign (average session duration, bounce rate, and page session)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p>To balance stakeholder and user needs, I created a user testing script and conducted interviews with five members of the CFE community: bloggers, event attendees, and journalists.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Pain points</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Content is hard to navigate (long breadcrumb trails, redundant web pages)</li>
                        <li>Naming conventions are unclear (ie. podcasts, bibliographies)</li>
                        <li>Users unaware of important resources on the website (videos, recommended readings)</li>
                        <li>Home page → poor, too much scrolling, "not functional more sales-like"</li>
                        <li>Issue index page → poor experience, the user expects blog content first</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Content Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The site needed a simplified way to explore its wealth of resources. Before jumping into ideation, we needed to 'Clean House': take everything off the shelves and 'Marie Kondo' what content to keep and remove. I led a <strong>Content Audit Workshop</strong> with stakeholders to go through each type of resource and explore different ways to group it.</p>

                    <h3>User Flow + Wireframe</h3>
                    <p>I was curious about how to make the website more content/resource-focused. Previously, the homepage functioned as a landing page with a few links to the latest content. To prioritize CFE resources I explored creating a <strong>Resource Archive</strong>. On this page, users could search, filter, and sort through all CFE resources in one place.</p>

                    <h2>Testing & Validation</h2>
                    <p>To get user feedback, I created a simplified grayscale <strong>prototype</strong> and ran user testing sessions with five CFE community members.</p>
                    
                    <h3>User Feedback</h3>
                    <p>The overall feedback was positive. There were no major usability issues with the new homepage concept. The majority liked the new version for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cleaner interface</li>
                        <li>Improved navigation</li>

                    <p>The homepage was transformed into the resource archive: one space where users can easily search, sort and filter through content on the site.</p>

                    <p>Users wanted an easy way to understand what the Centre was about. In addition to being a navigation tool, the About dropdown provides an overview of the Centre and creates a framework to guide users through the site's resources.</p>
