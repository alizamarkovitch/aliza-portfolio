                    <h2>Background</h2>
                    <p>The Centre for Free Expression (CFE) is an organization within Ryerson University that provides
                        information about issues related to free expression in Canada and worldwide. The Centre's
                        website serves as a learning tool where users can explore information and attend events related
                        to free expression. Many resources are used by people who teach and study in this field.</p>
                    <p>CFE's goal was to present its resources in a more user-friendly way. I created an updated design
                        that was modern, easy to navigate, and scalable to accommodate for future growth.</p>
                </section>

                    <h2>Discover</h2>
                    <p><strong>Understand the problem + Collect Data (Research)</strong></p>
                    <p>To kick off the discovery phase, I facilitated a workshop to understand CFE's mission, the
                        website's purpose, and current pain points. The session
                        included the following activities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong><em>Brand Workshop</em></strong><em> </em>to learn about the organization and its
                            goals (Value proposition)</li>
                        <li><strong><em>Website Design Audit</em></strong> to identify areas for improvement</li>
                        <li><strong><em>Google Analytics</em></strong><em> data</em> analysis to better understand user
                            behavior</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The outcome of the workshop was:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An <strong><em>Organizational Summary</em></strong></li>
                        <li>A<strong> <em>Backlog</em></strong> of improvements and features for the new site</li>
                        <li>Defined <strong><em>KPIs</em></strong> to measure the success of the redesign (average
                            session duration, bounce rate, and page session).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p>To balance stakeholder and user needs, I created a user testing script and conducted interviews
                        with five members of the CFE community: bloggers, event attendees, and journalists.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pain points</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Content is hard to navigate (long breadcrumb trails, redundant web pages)</li>
                        <li>Naming conventions are unclear (ie. podcasts, bibliographies)</li>
                        <li>Users unaware of important resources on the website (videos, recommended readings)</li>
                        <li>Home page → poor, too much scrolling, "not functional more sales-like"</li>
                        <li>Issue index page → poor experience, the user expects blog content first</li>

                    <h2>Framing the problem</h2>
                    <p>I synthesized insights from research and stakeholder discussions to clearly define the problem
                        and project scope.</p>

                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unstructured information architecture made content hard to find.</li>
                        <li>Users struggled to navigate and explore key resources.</li>
                        <li>The outdated visual design impacted readability and engagement.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Goals</strong></p>

                        <li>Make the website resource-focused – Prioritize accessibility to key content.</li>

                    <h2>Content analysis</h2>
                    <p>The site needed a simplified way to explore its wealth of resources. Before ideation, we
                        conducted a content audit to assess which resources should be kept, removed, or reorganized for
                        better usability. I led a <strong>Content Audit Workshop</strong> with
                        stakeholders to go through each type of resource and explore different ways to group it.</p>

                    <h2>Ideation</h2>
                    <p><strong>User flow + Wireframe</strong></p>
                    <p>I was curious about how to make the website more content/resource-focused. The original homepage
                        served mainly as a landing page with minimal content visibility. To improve discoverability, I
                        designed a centralized Resource Archive where users could search, filter, and sort CFE's
                        extensive content in one place.</p>
                    <p>The outcome was a revamped <strong><em>sitemap</em></strong> and a <strong><em>user
                                flow</em></strong> framework to search and explore content.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframe</h2>
                    <p>Lots of ideation work went into designing the Resource page. I explored design patterns that
                        allow users to refine their search/discovery of CFE resources with filters such as Issue Topic,
                        Category and Year. I learned that Issue Topics can be dynamic and therefore using a dropdown
                        component works best to keeps the interface clean and easy to navigate.</p>

                        ran user testing sessions with five CFE community members.</p>

                    <p><strong>User Feedback</strong></p>
                    <p>Usability testing confirmed that the redesign significantly improved navigation and usability.
