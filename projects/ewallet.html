                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In 2019, 2.1 billion global consumers were expected to use a digital wallet to make payments or send money. Mobile wallets are revolutionizing the customer experience. They provide a more secure and convenient alternative to using a payment card or cash.</p>
                    <p>To stay competitive within the market and leverage the benefits of a digital wallet, FoodPanda decided to develop its own mobile payment solution.</p>
                    <p>My team built and shipped the first iteration of pandapay, a mobile bank-like feature within food delivery application, FoodPanda.</p>
