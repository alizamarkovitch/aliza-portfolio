                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>League is a digital healthcare company in Canada that develops solutions empowering insurance providers to deliver exceptional digital health experiences. The Customer Support Portal (CS Portal) enhances the capabilities of client customer service teams to resolve support inquiries effectively and securely.</p>
                </section>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>Team and Role</h2>
                    <p>I led the design efforts as the Lead Designer alongside a Product Manager and five developers, reporting to the Director of Product Design. We were part of a broader design team that included ten designers.</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>Customer support agents at our client sites interact with members via chat or phone, needing real-time access to member data to resolve inquiries efficiently. Previously, agents logged into members' accounts to resolve issues, which posed significant privacy and security risks. Our objective was to eliminate these risks while enhancing the speed and effectiveness of support interactions.</p>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>The CS Portal is a dedicated tool that enables customer support agents to view and interact with member data without compromising privacy. This tool allows agents to navigate member issues in the app, update data, and engage members within a secure environment.</p>

                    <h2>Design Process</h2>
                    <h3>Discovery Phase</h3>
                    <p>We engaged front-line customer support agents through interviews and secondary research. Key findings revealed confusion over missing points and challenges in completing tasks. This insight directly influenced the layout and functionality of the CS Portal.</p>

                    <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
                    <p>Developed a comprehensive diagram that outlines the CS Portal's structure, emphasizing easy navigation and future scalability.</p>

                    <h2>User Feedback & Iterations</h2>
                    <p>After the initial prototype, we conducted feedback sessions with four distinct user groups: front-line agents, secondary support teams, and specialized troubleshooting teams. Key improvements implemented based on feedback:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added 'Platform type' column into recent sessions</li>
