                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p><strong>League</strong> is a Canadian digital healthcare company that empowers insurers to
                        deliver exceptional digital health experiences. The <strong>Customer Support Portal (CS
                            Portal)</strong> was designed to enhance client customer service teams' ability to resolve
                        support inquiries <strong>efficiently and securely</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        Customer support agents at our client sites interact with members via chat or phone, requiring
                            <strong>real-time access</strong> to <strong>member data</strong> to resolve inquiries efficiently. Previously, agents logged
                            into members' accounts to troubleshoot, posing privacy and security risks. Our goal was to
                            eliminate security concerns while improving the speed and accuracy of support
                            interactions.</p>

                        <h3>Discovery</h3>
                        <p>We conducted extensive <strong>internal and external research</strong> to understand the
                            needs of all stakeholders, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Highmark</strong> (Client Support Team, Health Insurance Provider)</li>
                            <li><strong>Customer Support & League Support Teams (Internal Support Teams)</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Capability Teams</strong> (Internal Capability Teams)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Engaging with <strong>front-line customer support agents </strong>, we identified key pain
                            points:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Confusion over missing points</strong> – Agents struggled to track member
                                activity and resolve inquiries efficiently.</li>
                            <li><strong>Task complexity</strong> – Completing routine support tasks required
                                navigating multiple disconnected tools.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>These insights directly influenced the <strong>layout and functionality</strong> of the CS
                            Portal, guiding our design towards <strong>clear displays and streamlined
                                navigation</strong> to improve efficiency. Findings were synthesized in an
                            <strong>Affinity
                                Map</strong>, categorizing <strong>user pain points and key themes</strong> that shaped
                            our design decisions.

                        <p>With a clear understanding of user challenges, we explored multiple design approaches to
                            create a seamless and intuitive experience. Our goal was to simplify workflows while
                            ensuring support agents could access critical information efficiently.</p>

                        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
                        <p>To ensure easy navigation and scalability, we developed a <strong>comprehensive Information

                        <p>We facilitated a <strong>User Story Mapping workshop</strong> with stakeholders to align on
                            the most important features and functionalities. This helped us prioritize key tasks and

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Front-line agents</strong> – Primary users handling customer inquiries daily.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Secondary support teams</strong> – Assisted with complex case escalations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Specialized troubleshooting teams</strong> – Focused on resolving high-impact

                        <h3>Testing Approach</h3>
                        <p>Due to client constraints, we conducted feedback sessions using a <strong>structured demo
                                script </strong> to maintain consistency and ensure comprehensive testing. Participants
                            were guided through core workflows, focusing on key interactions and pain points.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Data continuity</strong>: Users valued the ability to reference past member

                            <li><strong>Refined terminology</strong>: Adjusted specific labels for clarity and alignment

                            <li><strong>Design QA & testing</strong> – Conducted audits to ensure accessibility

                        <p>The <strong>Customer Support Portal</strong> has transformed the way agents interact with
                            member data, offering a <strong>secure, efficient, and user-friendly</strong> solution. By
                            aligning with <strong>both client needs and privacy standards</strong>, we have empowered
                            support teams to resolve issues autonomously while maintaining <strong>compliance and data
                                security</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Looking ahead, we plan to focus on <strong>further optimizing workflow automation</strong>
                            and <strong>improving data accessibility</strong>, ensuring the portal remains a valuable
                            tool for support teams.</p>
