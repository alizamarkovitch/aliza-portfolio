                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    Tim Hortons is the largest quick-service restaurant chain in Canada, with 4.9K restaurants in 15
                    countries worldwide. As a <strong>Product Designer on the Ecosystem team</strong>, I led the
                    redesign of key mobile
                    experiences, focusing on reimagining the in-store mobile payment flow.

                    The outcome was a <strong>modernized interface</strong> with enhanced services and features. This
                    case study outlines
                    the UX redesign of <strong>'Scan'</strong>, the app's most-used feature for mobile payments and
                    rewards.

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Scan is the most-used feature in the Tim Hortons app, allowing customers to make quick payments and earn rewards in-store. As the <strong>most used feature in the app</strong>, it was critical to
                        improve its efficiency and user experience.</p>
                    <p>Our goal was to simplify checkout by combining payment and rewards into a single seamless action.</p>
                    <h3>Key Tasks</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scan once to pay & earn rewards </strong>– Eliminate extra scanning steps.</li>
                        <li><strong>Centralize payment settings </strong>– Make managing payment methods easier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplify reward management</strong> – Combine payment and rewards in one place.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>Pain Points</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Two-step scanning process:</strong> Users had to scan twice—once for rewards, once
                            for payment—slowing down checkout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dispersed settings:</strong> Payment and reward preferences were in separate parts
                            of the app, making them hard to manage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inconsistent UI elements:</strong> Various interaction styles (tabs, toggles, text
                            links) increased cognitive load.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>

                <section class="project-section">
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <h3>One Tap to Scan, Pay and Earn</h3>
                    <p>Our research showed that shifting from a <strong>customer-presented QR code to a vendor-scanned QR code</strong> improved speed and reduced errors.</p>
                    <p>This updated interaction speeds up the in-store check-out </strong> experience and reduces
                        scanning issues
                        related to vendor devices. <strong>Scan pay and earn points in one tap.</strong></p>

                    <h3>All payment settings in one place</h3>
                    <p>Data analytics highlighted a correlation between <strong> scanning time and changing reward
                            tiers.</strong>
                        Moreover, <strong></strong>160K customers edit rewards levels per day.</strong></p>
                    <p>Previously payment-related features were siloed into different areas of the app. The Wallet
                        consolidates all payment-related activities. Customers can easily manage payments, reward
                        settings, and transaction activity all in one place.</p>
