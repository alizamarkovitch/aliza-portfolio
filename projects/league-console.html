                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>This project was completed while I was working at League, a digital healthcare company that empowers health providers to deliver exceptional digital health experiences. Our latest project, the League Console, not only streamlines the in-app configuration process but also marks a significant step towards digital autonomy, reducing dependency on technical staff for daily operations.</p>

                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>League's 2024 goal is to offer a platform-centric service for clients to scale effectively and work autonomously. The current fragmented, error-prone configuration process demands technical expertise, slowing down campaign deployment and impacting client satisfaction. Our objective is to enable self-service and reduce reliance on internal teams.</p>

                    <p>As the Lead Designer of the Content & Configuration Tools pod, I spearheaded the design of the configuration interface, which reduced setup time by 40% and significantly improved user satisfaction. I worked alongside a Product Manager and a development team, reporting to the Director of Product Design.</p>
